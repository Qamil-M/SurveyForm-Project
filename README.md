# Survey Form Project

## 🚀 Introduction
This project is my first step into the world of software engineering. It began as part of my learning journey through FreeCodeCamp's curriculum, where I built a basic survey form using HTML. I later decided to enhance it by making it more functional and visually appealing with CSS.

## 🦾 Current Features
- Responsive and clean layout using CSS.
- Basic form elements like text inputs, radio buttons, and a submit button.
- User-friendly design optimized for different screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- Introduce JavaScript to validate form inputs and enhance interactivity.
- Implement backend functionality to handle form submissions.
- Add features such as form data storage and user analytics.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
This project is a hands-on way for me to apply and deepen my understanding of web development concepts, including:
- Building structured, accessible websites with semantic HTML.
- Styling and responsive design using CSS.
- Interactive functionality using JavaScript.
- Full-stack development with backend technologies.
